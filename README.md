# PolyCare

PolyCare is a web-based application built using React that provides a comprehensive solution for managing appointments at our healthcare clinic. It offers persistent login functionality and role-based authorization to cater to different users' needs.

## Features

### Persistent Login

PolyCare provides a seamless login experience. Once users log in, they stay authenticated until they choose to log out. This ensures a convenient and secure experience, especially for returning users.

### Role-Based Authorization

PolyCare offers role-based authorization to distinguish between different user types, including:

- **Patients**: Patients can view available appointment slots, book appointments, and receive appointment reminders.

- **Clinic Staff**: Clinic staff can manage and schedule appointments, view patient information, and assist patients in person or over the phone.

### Tech Stack

- React.js
